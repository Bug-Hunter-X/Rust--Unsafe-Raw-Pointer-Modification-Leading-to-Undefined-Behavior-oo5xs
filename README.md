This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains code that modifies a vector through a raw pointer, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version using safer methods to avoid such issues. This error is particularly subtle because the compiler might not directly catch it during compilation. This error could lead to unexpected program termination or data corruption, highlighting the need for careful management of raw pointers in Rust.
